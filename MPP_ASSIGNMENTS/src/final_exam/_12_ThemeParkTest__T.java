         * Why did chaos (multiple setups) occur?
         *
         *      This check is not synchronized. In a multithreaded environment, the following can happen:
         *      Thread A checks instance == null ‚Üí it's true
         *      Thread B checks instance == null ‚Üí also true (before Thread A finishes creating it)
         *      Both threads proceed to create a new instance ‚Üí singleton is broken
         * How can you protect the chocolate (make the singleton thread-safe)?
         * Fix it with: synchronized or double-checked locking with volatile.
         * What could happen in a real-world system (data corruption, wasted resources, etc.) if you don‚Äôt enforce the singleton?
         * üåç Real-World Consequences of a Broken Singleton
         * Problem	Description
         * Data corruption:	    Multiple instances can lead to conflicting writes (e.g., double dispensing chocolate üç´).
         * Wasted resources:	Extra objects = more memory, unnecessary connections, file handles, etc.
         * Inconsistent state:	Logging, config files, caches, or payment processors might show strange behavior.
         * Hard-to-debug bugs:	Race conditions are often non-deterministic and painful to trace.
