/*
You are developing a banking application. At the end of the day, your system needs to process hundreds of
deposits made by different customers to the same bank account.

* You create a shared BankAccount object with a balance. Each deposit is performed in its own thread (using executor.execute(Runnable)).
* You need to ensure that the final balance is correct after all depositsâ€”i.e., all deposits are applied
    safely, with no lost updates due to concurrency.

* Implement a BankAccount class with methods to deposit money and get the balance.
* Launch N deposit tasks in parallel using executor.execute(), each depositing $100.
* Print the final balance after all deposits have completed.
* Ensure thread-safety so the final balance is correct (N * $100 + initial balance).
